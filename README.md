<h2>How to Play</h2>
In this game, a swarm of cats is tearing towards your carpet. Use drag and drop to toss them in kitty prison, or they'll be
tearing up your carpet. As time goes on the cats spawn faster and faster, try and last as long as you can!
<h2>Background</h2>
This advanced cat grabbing simulator was inspired by various online defense games as well as some *ahem* "current events."
It was written in JavaScript and uses the CreateJS suite, including EaselJS for 2D rendering and DOM manipulation, TweenJS for
ticker support, and PreloadJS for loading of assets.
